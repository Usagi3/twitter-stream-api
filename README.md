Consume the Twitter Stream API v2 in real-time.

This package is the spiritual successor of `fennb/phirehose`.

## Getting started

> Requires [PHP 8.0+](https://www.php.net/releases/)

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require redwebcreation/twitter-stream-api
```

## Usage

```php
use RWC\TwitterStream\RuleBuilder;
use RWC\TwitterStream\Fieldset;
use RWC\TwitterStream\Sets;
use RWC\TwitterStream\TwitterStream;

$twitterStream = new TwitterStream();
$connection = new \RWC\TwitterStream\Connection(
    $bearerToken = '...',
);
$rule     = new RuleManager($connection);

$rule->save(
    $rule->query('cats')
        ->not->has('images')
        ->has('videos'),
    'dogs without images but with videos'
);
$twitterStream
    ->backfill(2) // for "academic research" accounts only
    ->expansions(['author_id'])
    ->fields(['media.duration_ms', 'media.height'])
    ->fields(['place.full_name', 'place.geo', 'place.id'])
    ->listen($connection, function (array $tweet) {
        echo $tweet['data']['text'];
        
        if ($this->received >= 100) {
            $this->stopListening();
        }
});
```

## Rules

Rules are made up of one or many operators that are combined using boolean logic and parentheses to help define which
Tweets your stream receives. Rules are saved by Twitter and are persistent.

### Client

```php
use RWC\TwitterStream\RuleBuilder;

$rules = new RuleManager($connection);
```

### Listing all the rules

```php
$rules->all();
```

#### Saving a rule

```php
use RWC\TwitterStream\Rule;

$rules->save(
  'cat has:image',
  'cat with an image'
)

// Using saveMany to create many rules is more efficient than using save
// as it only sends one request to Twitter as opposed to sending one request per rule.
$rules->saveMany([
    new Rule('cat has:image', 'cat with an image'),
    new Rule('cat has:video', 'cat with a video'),
    new Rule ('dog -has:image', 'dog without an image'),
])
```

If no tag is provided, the fallback is the rule content itself.

For your convenience, there's a query builder for rules available, learn more [here](#rule-builder).

#### Deleting a rule

```php
use RWC\TwitterStream\Rule;

$rules->delete('THE_RULE_ID_HERE');


// Using deleteMany to create many rules is more efficient than using delete
// as it only sends one request to Twitter as opposed to sending one request per rule.
$rules->deleteMany([
    new Rule('cat has:image', 'cat with an image'),
    new Rule('cat has:video', 'cat with a video'),
    new Rule ('dog -has:image', 'dog without an image'),
])
```

## Rule Builder

```php
use RWC\TwitterStream\RuleBuilder;

$builder = $client->query('php')
    ->group(fn (RuleBuilder $builder) => $builder->raw('tip')->or()->raw('ðŸ”¥'))
    ->is('retweets')
    ->has('images')
    ->not->has('links');

// Produces #php (tip OR ðŸ”¥) is:retweet has:images -has:links
```

You can negate an operator using the magic property `not`.

```php
use RWC\TwitterStream\RuleBuilder;
RuleBuilder::create('#php')
  ->not->is('retweets')
  ->has('links');

// Produces: #php -is:retweet has:links
```

You can also group operators together :

```php
use RWC\TwitterStream\RuleBuilder;
RuleBuilder::create('#laravel')
    ->group(function (RuleBuilder $builder) {
        $builder->raw('tip')->or()->raw('tips')->or()->raw('ðŸ”¥');
    });

// Produces: #laravel (tip OR tips OR ðŸ”¥)
```
